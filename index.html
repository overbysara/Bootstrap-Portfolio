      <p class="text-justify">My name is Sara Overby. In the late 90s, my friends and I taught ourselves web design and development. Life took me away from coding, but the DU Coding Bootcamp gave me an exciting opportunity to jump back in. I have a Masters Degree in Public Administration from the University of Colorado. I am passionate about the work of the public and nonprofit sectors.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Currently I work in philanthropy as a Program Officer at the Colorado Health Foundation. As part of my work, I travel to meet with municipal and community leaders in Southwestern Colorado, including the beautiful towns of Cortez, Durango, and Salida. At the Foundation I have funded telehealth projects to increase access to health care services in rural areas, renovations of buildings and playgrounds, and community groups working on advocacy and social justice issues.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">My husband and I live in the East Colfax neighborhood with our strong-willed daughter, three dogs, and a big ol' cabinet of board games.</p>
